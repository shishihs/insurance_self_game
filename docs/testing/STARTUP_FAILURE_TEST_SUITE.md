## üîç What These Tests Protect Against

### Real-World Scenarios
1. **Mobile Safari WebGL Failures** - iOS Safari randomly failing to create WebGL context
2. **Chrome Canvas Memory Leaks** - Chrome's known canvas memory leak causing crashes
3. **Firefox Context Limits** - Firefox's 16 WebGL context limit causing failures
4. **Android Browser Quirks** - Old Android browsers with broken touch events
5. **Network Instability** - Users on unreliable connections getting stuck on loading
6. **Corporate Firewalls** - CSP and CORS restrictions blocking game assets
7. **Low-End Devices** - Memory pressure and CPU throttling causing failures
8. **Multiple Tab Scenarios** - Users opening multiple game tabs causing resource conflicts

### Edge Cases That Actually Happen
1. **Rapid Page Navigation** - Users clicking refresh during game loading
2. **Network Switching** - Mobile users moving between WiFi and cellular
3. **Browser Updates** - New Chrome/Firefox versions breaking WebGL support
4. **AdBlockers and Extensions** - Browser extensions interfering with game loading
5. **Corporate Proxies** - Company proxies corrupting binary assets
6. **Battery Saver Mode** - Mobile devices throttling performance during games
7. **Background Tab Throttling** - Browsers pausing JavaScript in background tabs
8. **Private Browsing Mode** - Safari's localStorage restrictions in private mode

## üö® Critical Success Criteria

**Remember**: These tests exist because Murphy's Law applies especially to web applications. If something *can* go wrong, it *will* go wrong, usually at the worst possible moment. Our job as the Test Paranoid is to catch these issues before users do.
