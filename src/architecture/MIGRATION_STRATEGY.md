# Migration Strategy: Legacy to Modern Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step migration strategy from the existing monolithic architecture to the new modern, DDD-based architecture. The migration will be performed incrementally to maintain system stability and ensure zero-downtime deployment.

## Current Architecture Problems

### Identified Code Smells
1. **God Class**: `Game.ts` (1057 lines) - violates Single Responsibility Principle
2. **Tight Coupling**: Direct dependencies between layers
3. **Mixed Concerns**: UI logic mixed with business logic
4. **Lack of Abstraction**: Concrete implementations everywhere
5. **Testing Difficulties**: Tightly coupled code is hard to test

### Architecture Issues
1. **No Clear Boundaries**: Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers are mixed
2. **Direct Database Access**: Domain entities directly handle persistence
3. **Missing Abstractions**: No interfaces for external dependencies
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error handling patterns throughout
5. **Poor Scalability**: Monolithic structure limits feature development

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish new architecture foundation without breaking existing functionality

#### Tasks:
- [x] Create core DDD building blocks (AggregateRoot, ValueObject, EntityId)
- [x] Implement SOLID principle interfaces
- [x] Set up dependency injection container
- [x] Create service factory pattern
- [ ] Implement adapter pattern for existing services

#### Success Criteria:
- New architecture foundation is in place
- All existing tests still pass
- No functional regressions

#### Risk Mitigation:
- Keep existing code untouched during foundation setup
- Use adapter pattern to bridge old and new systems
- Implement comprehensive monitoring

### Phase 2: Domain Layer Migration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Extract and refactor domain logic from the monolithic Game class

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Extract GameAggregate from existing Game class
- [ ] Create Value Objects (Vitality, InsurancePremium, etc.)
- [ ] Implement Domain Events system
- [ ] Create Domain Services for complex business logic
- [ ] Establish Aggregate boundaries

#### Migration Process:
```typescript
// Step 1: Create parallel GameAggregate
const legacyGame = new Game(config)  // Keep existing
const newGame = GameAggregate.create(config)  // New implementation

// Step 2: Dual-write pattern
function updateVitality(amount: number) {
  legacyGame.heal(amount)        // Update legacy
  newGame.heal(amount, 'healing') // Update new
  
  // Compare results for consistency
  assert(legacyGame.vitality === newGame.vitality.getValue())
}

// Step 3: Gradually switch reads to new system
function getVitality(): number {
  if (featureFlag.useNewArchitecture) {
    return newGame.vitality.getValue()
  }
  return legacyGame.vitality
}
```

#### Success Criteria:
- Domain logic is properly encapsulated
- Business rules are enforced by aggregates
- Domain events are properly raised
- All business logic tests pass with new implementation

### Phase 3: Application Layer Migration (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Implement application services and command/query separation

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Command handlers for all game operations
- [ ] Implement Query services for read operations
- [ ] Set up Command Bus for operation routing
- [ ] Create Application Services as facade
- [ ] Implement Unit of Work pattern

#### Migration Process:
```typescript
// Step 1: Wrap existing operations in commands
class LegacyGameController {
  async startGame(config: GameConfig) {
    // Wrap legacy call in command
    const command = new StartGameCommand(config)
    return await this.commandBus.dispatch(command)
  }
}

// Step 2: Command handlers delegate to new domain
class StartGameCommandHandler {
  async handle(command: StartGameCommand): Promise<CommandResult> {
    const game = GameAggregate.create(command.configuration)
    game.start()
    await this.repository.save(game)
    return successResult({ gameId: game.id.getValue() })
  }
}
```

#### Success Criteria:
- All game operations are command-driven
- Read operations use dedicated query services
- Application layer properly orchestrates domain operations
- Event publishing works correctly

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Layer Migration (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Replace direct dependencies with abstracted infrastructure services

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement Repository pattern for data access
- [ ] Create Event Publisher for domain events
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement caching layer
- [ ] Create external service adapters

#### Migration Process:
```typescript
// Step 1: Create repository implementations
class GameRepositoryAdapter implements IGameRepository {
  constructor(private legacyGameController: GameController) {}
  
  async save(game: GameAggregate): Promise<void> {
    // Temporarily sync with legacy system
    const legacyGame = this.convertToLegacy(game)
    await this.legacyGameController.saveGame(legacyGame)
  }
}

// Step 2: Gradually replace with proper persistence
class IndexedDBGameRepository implements IGameRepository {
  async save(game: GameAggregate): Promise<void> {
    const snapshot = this.serializeAggregate(game)
    await this.db.put('games', snapshot)
  }
}
```

### Phase 5: Presentation Layer Migration (Week 9-10)
**Goal**: Refactor Vue components to use new architecture with Composition API

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Create Composables for game state management
- [ ] Implement reactive state management
- [ ] Create adapter components for backward compatibility
- [ ] Migrate UI components to use new composables
- [ ] Remove direct dependencies on legacy services

#### Migration Process:
```vue
<!-- Legacy Component -->
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      game: new Game()
    }
  },
  methods: {
    startGame() {
      this.game.start()
    }
  }
}
</script>

<!-- Migrated Component -->
<script setup>
const { state, actions } = useGameState(
  inject(SERVICE_TOKENS.GAME_REPOSITORY),
  inject(SERVICE_TOKENS.EVENT_PUBLISHER),
  inject(SERVICE_TOKENS.COMMAND_BUS)
)

const startGame = () => actions.startGame()
</script>
```

### Phase 6: Legacy Code Removal (Week 11-12)
**Goal**: Remove legacy code and finalize migration

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Remove legacy Game class
- [ ] Clean up adapter classes
- [ ] Remove feature flags
- [ ] Update all tests to use new architecture
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation update

## Migration Tools and Techniques

### Strangler Fig Pattern
Gradually replace legacy components by wrapping them with new implementations:

```typescript
class GameServiceStrangler {
  constructor(
    private legacyService: LegacyGameService,
    private newService: NewGameService,
    private featureFlags: FeatureFlags
  ) {}
  
  async startGame(config: GameConfig): Promise<GameResult> {
    if (this.featureFlags.useNewGameService) {
      return await this.newService.startGame(config)
    }
    return await this.legacyService.startGame(config)
  }
}
```

### Feature Flags
Use feature flags to control rollout and enable quick rollback:

```typescript
enum FeatureFlag {
  USE_NEW_DOMAIN_MODEL = 'use_new_domain_model',
  USE_COMMAND_BUS = 'use_command_bus',
  USE_NEW_REPOSITORIES = 'use_new_repositories'
}

class FeatureFlags {
  isEnabled(flag: FeatureFlag): boolean {
    return this.config.features[flag] ?? false
  }
}
```

### Data Migration
Ensure data compatibility between old and new systems:

```typescript
class DataMigrationService {
  migrateGameData(legacyGame: LegacyGame): GameSnapshot {
    return {
      id: legacyGame.id,
      status: this.mapStatus(legacyGame.status),
      vitality: {
        value: legacyGame.vitality,
        maxValue: legacyGame.maxVitality
      },
      // ... other fields
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Migration Plan
1. **Keep Existing Tests**: Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
2. **Add Architecture Tests**: Test new architectural patterns
3. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction between old and new systems
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure no performance regression
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete user workflows

### Test Implementation
```typescript
describe('Game Migration', () => {
  let legacyGame: Game
  let newGame: GameAggregate
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    legacyGame = new Game(testConfig)
    newGame = GameAggregate.create(testConfig)
  })
  
  it('should maintain consistency between implementations', async () => {
    // Apply same operations to both
    legacyGame.start()
    newGame.start()
    
    legacyGame.heal(10)
    newGame.heal(10, 'healing')
    
    // Verify consistency
    expect(legacyGame.vitality).toBe(newGame.vitality.getValue())
    expect(legacyGame.status).toBe(newGame.status)
  })
})
```

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss or corruption
2. **Performance Impact**: New architecture might have performance overhead
3. **Feature Parity**: Risk of missing functionality in new implementation
4. **Team Productivity**: Learning curve for new patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Gradual Rollout**: Use feature flags for controlled deployment
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain high test coverage throughout migration
3. **Monitoring**: Implement detailed monitoring and alerting
4. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to quickly rollback to legacy system
5. **Documentation**: Keep detailed migration logs and documentation
